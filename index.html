	<p>The Secret was released as a film in March 2006, and later the same year as a book. The Secret by Rhonda Byrne is a book
		that says thoughts are powerful. They can either attract positive things or negative things from the universe, based on
		what those thoughts were about. If someone has negative thoughts, theyâ€™ll usually attract more negativity in their life.
		Positive thinkers will often attract positive things into their lives.
